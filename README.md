## Hacktoberfest

October is special in multiple ways. Usually, software developers celebrate open source software as part of Hactoberfest. It's a one-month event where developers can help open source software with their contribution in exchange for some swag.

Invertase.io brings it to the Flutter Community this year, you can join it at https://invertase.io/community/hacktoberfest

On the other hand, every year in October in Munich, Germany people gather around to drink beer during Oktoberfest. So if you don't want to participate in the Hactoberfest, but you want to learn something Flutter-related you can create the following app as part of October challenge, the HactOktoberfest App.

## The requirements of the app:

Imagine you go to drink some beer with your friends. It is better if you do it not just imagine :)
- You order beers and at the end you want to split your bill based on what you drink.
- Your goal is to make an app that can track your beer consumption.
- The app should provide a couple of beers to choose from, where the user can define the  price of each
- When you record an ordered beer, you can set who drinks it. Assign your friends from your contact list.
- Store all ordered beers in a local database. Use Isar for data storage: https://isar.dev/
- Show a summary of your order and a breakdown for each of your friends.
- Use any state management solution you want.
- By doing this challenge you'll geet familiar with Isar and how to access your contact list. Have fun and be responsible when you drink beers. :)
